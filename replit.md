# Portfolio Application

## Overview

This is a professional developer portfolio built as a full-stack web application featuring a modern sci-fi aesthetic. The application showcases a developer's skills, projects, experience, and provides contact functionality through a responsive, animated interface.

## System Architecture

The application follows a full-stack monorepo structure with clear separation between frontend and backend concerns:

- **Frontend**: React-based SPA with TypeScript, using modern UI libraries and animations
- **Backend**: Express.js server with PostgreSQL database integration
- **Shared**: Common schema definitions and types shared between frontend and backend

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom sci-fi themed variables
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui component library
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions and interactive effects
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Server**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Session Management**: Connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL-backed sessions
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for contact form submissions

### UI/UX Design System
- **Theme**: Futuristic sci-fi with terminal-style aesthetics
- **Typography**: Orbitron (display), JetBrains Mono (code), Inter (body)
- **Color Palette**: Dark backgrounds with neon accents (green, blue, purple, cyan)
- **Components**: Consistent cyber-styled borders, glow effects, and hover animations
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design with adaptive layouts

### Page Structure
1. **Home** (`/`): Hero section with typewriter terminal animation
2. **About** (`/about`): Personal bio with animated tech stack visualization
3. **Projects** (`/projects`): Grid showcase of portfolio projects with hover effects
4. **Experience** (`/experience`): Timeline-based work history presentation
5. **Contact** (`/contact`): Functional contact form with backend integration
6. **Resume** (`/resume`): Skills overview and resume display

## Data Flow

### Client-Side Navigation
